repostats
=========

Generates some charts with statistics about code base size and rate
of change

Starting with git commit logs, this generates two charts from the
first through last commit in the given repository

# Day-by-day number of lines of code (shows growth or shrinkage
  over time)

# Week by week percentage change in number of lines of code (a
  noisy measure of the rate of change)
