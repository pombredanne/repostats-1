repostats
=========

Generate some statistics about code base size and rate of change

Starting with git commit logs, this generates two charts from the
first through last commit in the given repository

1) Day-by-day number of lines of code (shows growth or shrinkage
   over time)

2) Week by week percentage change in number of lines of code (a
   noisy measure of the rate of change)
